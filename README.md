# notebook-library-mcp
Token-efficient document retrieval for substrate AI agents. Drop PDFs, text files, and markdown into notebook folders — they get chunked, embedded, and indexed for semantic search. Queries return only the most relevant passages (~2,500 tokens) instead of loading entire documents (50,000+).
